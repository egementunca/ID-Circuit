# ID-Circuit System Status Summary

## ‚úÖ Latest Fixes (Current Session)

### 1. Unroll Error Resolution ‚≠ê

-   **Problem**: AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get' in circuit unrolling
-   **Root Cause**: Code was calling `.get()` on a list instead of a dictionary in `_perform_circuit_unroll`
-   **Solution**: Added proper type checking to handle different equivalent formats:
    ```python
    if isinstance(equivalent, dict):
        equivalent_gates = equivalent.get('gates', [])
    elif isinstance(equivalent, list):
        equivalent_gates = equivalent
    else:
        equivalent_gates = equivalent
    ```
-   **Result**: Circuit unrolling now works correctly without data corruption

### 2. Dimension Group Data Consistency ‚≠ê

-   **Problem**: Circuit 13 with (3,10) dimensions incorrectly showing in (2,4) dimension group
-   **Solution**: Created and ran dimension group fix script that moved the circuit to correct group
-   **Result**: Clean data consistency - Dim Group 1: 4 circuits, Dim Group 2: 14 circuits

### 3. Circuit Pattern Diversity ‚≠ê

-   **Problem**: Missing alternating NOT pattern in circuit database
-   **Solution**: Manually added alternating pattern `[[[], 0], [[], 1], [[], 0], [[], 1]]` as Circuit 13
-   **Result**: Now have both consecutive and alternating NOT representatives for [4,0,0] composition

### 4. Seed Generator Improvements ‚≠ê

-   **Problem**: Random circuit generator producing repetitive patterns
-   **Solution**: Enhanced `_generate_random_circuit` with diversity tracking:
    -   Prevents consecutive identical patterns
    -   Alternates targets for NOT gates
    -   Varies control-target combinations for CNOTs
-   **Result**: More diverse circuit generation with better pattern coverage

### 5. Frontend Enhancements ‚≠ê

-   **Problem**: Equivalents showing as 0 despite circuits having proper equivalent relationships
-   **Investigation**: API returns correct counts (Circuit 1: 6, Circuit 13: 5, Circuit 5: 7) but frontend display was unclear
-   **Solution**: Enhanced frontend with:
    -   Summary statistics box showing total counts
    -   New "Inc. Sub-Seeds" column for total counts including sub-seeds
    -   Better visual organization of statistics
-   **Result**: Clear display of equivalent relationships and comprehensive statistics

## ‚úÖ Previously Fixed Issues

### 1. Core Data Corruption Bug

-   **Problem**: The `unroller.py` module was causing data corruption when processing circuit data
-   **Solution**: Fixed the `_record_to_circuit` method to properly validate and convert database records to sat_revsynth Circuit objects
-   **Result**: Circuit unrolling now works correctly without data corruption

### 2. ML Features Hashable Type Error

-   **Problem**: `ml_features.py` was trying to create sets from unhashable gate data
-   **Solution**: Fixed `_compute_gate_repetition_ratio` to convert control lists to tuples before adding to sets
-   **Result**: ML feature extraction now works without errors

### 3. Missing Database Method

-   **Problem**: `get_equivalent_count_for_dim_group` method was missing from the database class
-   **Solution**: Added the missing method to `CircuitDatabase` class
-   **Result**: Circuit generation workflow completes successfully

### 4. Database Schema Issues

-   **Problem**: Inconsistent database schema and relationship management
-   **Solution**: Implemented proper `representative_id` system and fixed relationship queries
-   **Result**: Clean data model with proper circuit grouping and representative management

-   **Impact**: Generation completes successfully, only affects post-processing step
-   **Status**: Non-critical, doesn't affect core functionality

### 2. Job Queue Warning

-   **Issue**: Job queue initialization warning due to missing Redis configuration
-   **Impact**: Background job processing not available
-   **Status**: Optional feature, core system works without it
